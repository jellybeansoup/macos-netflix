# Netflix wrapper for macOS

A very simple proof-of-concept app for a `WKWebView` based app to allow viewing Netflix outside the browser on macOS. The goal is to somewhat allow a picture-in-picture style browsing and watching experience. There's a bunch of similar apps on the Mac App Store, but this one is mine, and the idea is to keep it pretty lightweight (no majorly additive features).

## Installation Instructions

Go to [the page for the latest release](https://github.com/jellybeansoup/macos-netflix/releases/latest) and download the zipped app. You want the file labelled something akin to "Netflix.zip", and not the ones labelled "source code".

Unzip the app, and drag it into your Applications folder. If you accidentally downloaded the source code, you'll be quite confused, so go back a step and download the _other_ zip file.

That's all there is. Run and enjoy. I highly recommend watching "Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23"; such an excellent show, and Krysten Ritter is amaze.

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, try run the following in your terminal:
```shell
brew install --cask jellybeansoup-netflix
```
